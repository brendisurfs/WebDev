git uses hashes (sha1) to keep track of files within its ecosystem.

git diff - a way of comparing changes within a git repo.

commands: git diff --staged | git diff --[OPTION]

git sees similarity between files, which doesn't always make sense (not a renamed file). 
we can see the correct diff info with: 

	git diff --staged --no-renames


running
	git diff

just shows what changes have been made in the current working directory


COMMITS 

commits are easy. 
skip the staging area: git commit -a 
this basically skips the git add command. 


PUSH 

pushing to an origin repo: 
	
	git push origin [BRANCH]

this is to send it back to github/gitlab etc.


VIEW HISTORY

command:

	git log
